Console Engine

Description
---

*Console Engine*

Console-Engine is a shell that can be installed directly in Python through the Python Package Manager (PIP); Console-Engine was written in Python 2.7. With the help of the console engine, unlike in other shells, the arguments can be passed directly in Python, which increases the convenience for the user. In the early development stage, the console engine does not yet have a graphical overlay in the terminal, which of course should follow in the future. In addition, the way the console engine works is a completely new innovation that has never been seen before. Since the console engine is completely open source, the console engine can be implemented in many different programs and thus simplify tasks that would otherwise be complicated by complicated workarounds. In addition, the open source code allows other developers to improve the console engine or to fix the source of possible problems themselves. Small businesses can also benefit from Console Engine as it is completely free. 



*Who is Console Engine actually suitable for?*

Console-Engine is an opensource project that can be helpful in many areas. It is helpful for developers, programmers. It can also help white hat hackers with everyday problems. Console-Engine is also helpful to smaller companies if they are looking for additional convenience in their daily work, as Console-Engine can offer them this.
